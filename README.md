SiteKick is an application to help writers and editors who are not well-educated in SEO best-practices to take their 
optimization into their own hands. 

What It Does
------------
Users can sign in with a Tumblr account and direct the app to any of their most recent text-based posts. The app examines
the page's HTML output and runs what it finds through a series of SEO-related tests. Once a post has been selected, the
user is given a score and redirected to a page that offers feedback specific to the post.

Who Is Responsible
------------------

SiteKick was created as a final project for Dev Bootcamp San Francisco by a group of budding web developers:

* [Gabriela Zamudio](https://github.com/evagabriela)
* [Alex Fiore](https://github.com/alexfiore)
* [Luisa Beck](https://github.com/lbeck)
* [Dan Apczynski](https://github.com/danapczynski)
